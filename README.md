# Cyclistic Bike-Sharing: Data Analysis Case Study
In this data analysis case study, the bike-sharing fictional company Cyclistic wants to answer some important questions for the further development of the company through its rides database. The data used corresponds to the period from August 2021 to July 2022 and can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The public data are provided and licensed by Motivate International Inc. through 12 zipped .csv files. The objectives of this project are to do a data analysis to answer some questions about the company. For this were used:

- Excel and SQL Server for initial analysis;
- Data processing (cleaning, validation and exploration) through SQL queries (code documentation available in this repository);
- Data visualization through Tableu Public.

## Introduction
### Company background

Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company based in Chicago that launched in 2016. The company features more than 5,800 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of almost 700 stations across Chigaco. Apart from the traditional bikes, Cyclystic makes its service more inclusive by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo-bikes. In this sense, the bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 

So far, it is known that most users opt for traditional bikes, whereas 8% of riders use the assistive options. Moreover, most riders use the service 
for leisure purposes, but 30%  of them use bikes as a way of commuting to work every day. Cyclistic appeals to a broad consumer segment and the consumers of the service have the possibility of choosing between three plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Those who choose single-ride passes and full-day passes are referred to as "casual riders" while the riders who acquire an annual membership are referred to as "Cyclistic members".

### Business task

The company finance analysts have concluded that Cyclistic members are more profitable than casual riders. In this context, Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and manager of the data analyst team, believes that the key to the future growth of the company relies on maximizing the number of annual members. Thus, to design good marketing strategies, it is crucial to analyze the trends and behaviors of the two customer segments to understand how bike usage differs between casual riders and Cyclistic members.

### Key Business Questions

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
